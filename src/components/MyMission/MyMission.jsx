    <h1>My Mission</h1>

    <p>As a software developer in 2018 I frown upon the state of integration of IT solutions in businesses. It’s true, many now have a website and, if not, at least a Facebook page. But more often than not that website just replicates the functionality of a business card - it shows company name, logo, and maybe, just maybe has a contact form. While that might suffice for the initial phases of a business, later the owners come to realize that instead of bringing revenue or simplifying workflow, that website is just dead weight, and the maintainer vanished into the void without a trace.</p>
    <p>In light of that, I have resolved to put forth effort to fix that situation. For those who like it brief, here’s the short list of my objectives:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Understand your business and create a web application that well represents it and has the functionality to make your life easier.</li>
      <li>Stay available even after the end of the project, in case you want to make adjustments or add something new.</li>
      <li>Offer affordable, reasonable prices to match the needs of your local business.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now to some more details.</p>

    <h3>1. Understand your business</h3>
    <p>Sadly, a regular freelancer often isn’t motivated enough to really dive into your sphere and deliver something truly useful. I on the other hand, resolve to be not merely a contractor, but a collaborator. I will work with you to understand your needs and problems and offer appropriate technical solutions to solve those.</p>
    <p>And more: I will not limit myself to the tools I can create (which are numerous). The internet these days is full of beautiful, simple and inexpensive solutions for any needs. They are already perfected and polished to do specific tasks, so using them is a breeze. I can offer a consultation on which ones can suit your needs better, and integrate them into the website I am creating for even simpler use.</p>

    <h3>2. Stay available</h3>
    <p>
      Working with regular freelancers could often be compared to a one night stand: it’s exciting at first, but you are left with nothing the next day and they never call you back. I am not a one night stand. If I work with you on your project, it will be a lasting collaboration. Even after the project is done, I will be available to continue consulting you on the project and the side tools. Might you want to integrate more features into the project later? I will be there for that as well. It will be like having your own developer in the office, only without the drag of employing him.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Offer affordable, reasonable prices</h3>
    <p>Freelancers and web studios quite often are deprived of conscience when it comes to businesses. They will charge you thousands of dollars for a single logo and it will suck. That is something I don’t believe in. I believe that if you have a small business that cannot just throw $50k on a website, you still deserve something useful that represents you. That is why I will be flexible and adjust to your budget. With me crazy good doesn’t have to be crazy expensive!</p>
